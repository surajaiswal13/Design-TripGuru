-------------------------- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------------------------

## Problem 2: The Coupon Promotions Problem

There are multiple countries that we are operating our tourism business in. There are multiple cities in each country, and multiple tours in each city.

We’re also selling our tours on b2b platforms (like airbnb, getyourguide etc.) and our own b2c platform. We’re running a lot of marketing campaigns and provide discount coupons depending on many aspects like location, tour, timing, whether the user is a returning customer etc.

We wanna create a coupons/discount system that is able to accommodate the following requirements/cases:

1. A coupon (AIRBALI) can be required to manually applicable if the booking comes from a specific city and from a specific b2b platform. (e.g., booking comes from airbnb in bali) @
2. A coupon (AUTOTHAI) should be automatically applicable for all the cities and all tours in a specific country. (e.g., bookings coming in Thailand from any platform for any tours)
3. A coupon can be manually applied for all tours in Bali expect one trekking tour. 
4. A coupon can be automatically applied for all the bookings coming from our b2c platform.
5. A coupon can be automatically applied for all the bookings coming from all the platforms expect our b2c platform.

Platforms examples include: TripGuru(b2c), Airbnb(b2b), GetYourGuide(b2b), Klook(b2b) etc.

Create a system including database schema that is able to provide the functionality satisfying the business requirements.
